# socialmedia_signed-network--from-text
**3    Signed Networks from Text **<br/><br/> 
Instructions:<br/>
Like in real life, our actions on social media can have both a negative or a positive connotation. We can be friends with somebody (positive interaction) or we can downvote somebody’s comment (negative interac-tion). This is recorded in metadata like likes, downvotes, etc. However, often we lack explicit signals about the sign of a social exchange. A good example is Twitter, where there is no ‘dislike’ button. In these cases, the text of a message could be used to infer the sign of the interaction. Can we take advantage of these data to test existing theories about signed social exchanges, like the theory of structural balance or the theory of social status?
